# Keep-alive Investigation Summary

## Root Cause Identified
**Vega gateway is not sending any packets back to us after initial connection**

## Evidence
1. **Keep-alive task is working correctly**
   - Tasks start properly and remain running
   - Sending keep-alives every 10 seconds as expected
   - Task is NOT being cancelled

2. **Asymmetric communication pattern**
   - Vega (136.62.52.28): We send keep-alives, receive NOTHING back
   - Technic (100.27.151.80): We send keep-alives, receive some back

3. **No decryption errors from vega**
   - If vega was sending packets with wrong keys, we'd see decryption errors
   - Zero errors suggests packets aren't arriving at all

## Possible Causes (in order of likelihood)

### 1. AWS Security Group / Firewall Issue
- Vega is on EC2, may have restrictive security group rules
- UDP hole punching might work initially but fail for subsequent packets
- Stateful firewall might be timing out the connection state

### 2. Vega Gateway Bug
- Vega's keep-alive sending mechanism might be broken
- Previous evidence showed vega sends keep-alives for ~30s then stops
- Could be a bug in the gateway implementation

### 3. NAT/Network Issue
- Something specific to AWS networking
- UDP packets might be getting dropped
- MTU issues (though initial connection works)

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Check AWS security group configuration for vega EC2 instance
2. Check vega gateway logs to see if it's attempting to send keep-alives
3. Test with tcpdump/packet capture to verify packets on the wire
4. Consider that this might be the same issue that's been plaguing the system
