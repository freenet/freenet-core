# CRITICAL FINDING: Socket send_to() Returns Success But Kernel Drops Packets!

## Evidence:
1. **Application logs show successful sends**:
   ```
   Socket send_to completed, dest_addr: 136.62.52.28:36942, bytes_sent: 74
   ```

2. **tcpdump shows ZERO packets leaving**:
   - Monitored all interfaces: 0 packets
   - Monitored specific interface (enX0): 0 packets
   - No UDP packets to 136.62.52.28 at all

3. **Kernel statistics confirm packets NOT sent**:
   - Before: `OutDatagrams: 193634277`
   - After 3 seconds: `OutDatagrams: 193634277` (NO CHANGE!)
   - But `InDatagrams` increased by 71

4. **No firewall rules blocking**:
   - iptables OUTPUT chain: ACCEPT all
   - AWS security groups: Correct
   - No kernel errors in dmesg

## This is a KERNEL BUG or SILENT DROP!

The `send_to()` system call is returning the number of bytes "sent" but the kernel is silently dropping the packets before they reach the network interface.

## Possible Causes:
1. **Kernel bug** - send_to() returning false success
2. **Socket misconfiguration** - some socket option causing silent drops
3. **Memory/buffer issue** - but no errors in /proc/net/snmp
4. **AWS/virtualization issue** - hypervisor dropping packets?

## Next Debug Steps:
1. Check socket options with getsockopt
2. Try creating a simple test program to isolate the issue
3. Check if this affects all UDP or just our packets
4. strace the process to see actual syscalls
