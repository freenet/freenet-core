# AWS Investigation Results

## Instance Details
- **Instance ID**: i-0d6fa81f471759dc0  
- **Name**: Vega: Ian's Personal Projects
- **Public IP**: 100.27.151.80 (vega.locut.us)
- **Private IP**: 172.30.4.21
- **Region**: us-east-1 (N. Virginia)

## Security Configuration ✅ ALL CORRECT

### Security Group (sg-0f4b9b9b5bf2a8cbb)
**Inbound Rules:**
- ✅ UDP port 31337 from 0.0.0.0/0 (Freenet UDP traffic)
- TCP port 22 (SSH)
- TCP port 80 (HTTP)
- TCP port 443 (HTTPS)
- UDP ports 50003-50004 (UDP holepunch test)

**Outbound Rules:**
- ✅ ALL traffic allowed (protocol -1)

### Network ACLs
- ✅ Allow ALL inbound traffic (rule 100)
- ✅ Allow ALL outbound traffic (rule 100)

## Conclusion
**AWS networking is NOT the problem!** 

The security group and network ACLs are configured correctly to allow:
- Inbound UDP on port 31337 from anywhere
- Outbound UDP to anywhere

## Next Investigation Steps
Since AWS networking is correct, the issue must be:

1. **Vega gateway software bug** - not sending keep-alive packets
2. **OS-level firewall** on the EC2 instance (iptables/ufw)
3. **Application-level issue** - gateway might be failing to send responses

Need to:
- SSH into vega and check gateway logs
- Check iptables/ufw rules on the instance
- Verify gateway is actually trying to send keep-alives
