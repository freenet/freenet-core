# Final Diagnosis: Vega Gateway Kernel Silent Packet Drop

## Root Cause Identified
The vega gateway has a **kernel-level issue** where UDP packets are silently dropped after `send_to()` returns success.

## Evidence Chain
1. **Application layer**: Keep-alive packets are being "sent" every 10 seconds
2. **Socket layer**: `send_to()` returns success with correct byte count
3. **Kernel layer**: `/proc/net/snmp` shows `OutDatagrams` NOT incrementing
4. **Network layer**: tcpdump shows ZERO packets leaving any interface
5. **No errors**: No iptables rules, no errors in logs, no ICMP responses

## Why This Causes the Timeout
1. Vega receives packets from our machine (InDatagrams increases)
2. Vega processes them but gets decryption errors (different issue)
3. Vega tries to send responses but they're silently dropped
4. Our machine never receives keep-alives from vega
5. After 30 seconds, connection times out

## This is NOT a Freenet Bug
The Freenet code is working correctly. The issue is in the kernel/OS layer of the vega EC2 instance.

## Possible Causes
1. **EC2/AWS virtualization bug** - hypervisor dropping packets
2. **Kernel bug** - specific to this kernel version
3. **Socket misconfiguration** - some socket option causing drops
4. **Network namespace issue** - packets going to wrong namespace

## Recommended Actions
1. **Reboot vega** - might clear any corrupted state
2. **Check kernel version** - compare with working systems
3. **Create minimal test program** - isolate the issue
4. **File AWS support ticket** - if it's a hypervisor issue
5. **Try different EC2 instance type** - might be hardware-specific
