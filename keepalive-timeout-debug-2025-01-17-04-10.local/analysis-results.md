# Keep-alive Analysis Results

## Key Finding: Keep-alive packets are being SENT but NOT RECEIVED

### Evidence from logs:

1. **Keep-alive task lifecycle (Hypothesis #1: REFUTED)**
   - Keep-alive tasks START correctly when connections are established
   - Keep-alive tasks are STILL RUNNING when timeout occurs
   - ERROR log: "Keep-alive task is STILL RUNNING despite timeout!"
   - Tasks do NOT exit prematurely

2. **Keep-alive sending pattern (vega 136.62.52.28)**
   - First connection (13:58:59 - 13:59:30): 
     - Sent 3 keep-alives (packet IDs: 8, 9, 10) at 10s intervals
     - Timeout after exactly 30 seconds
   - Subsequent reconnections show same pattern

3. **Keep-alive receiving pattern**
   - ZERO keep-alive packets received from vega
   - This explains the 30-second timeout

## Timeline for first vega connection:
- 13:58:59.243: Keep-alive task STARTED
- 13:59:09.244: Keep-alive sent (packet 8) - 10s after start
- 13:59:19.244: Keep-alive sent (packet 9) - 20s after start  
- 13:59:29.244: Keep-alive sent (packet 10) - 30s after start
- 13:59:30.131: CONNECTION TIMEOUT at 30.001s
- 13:59:30.131: ERROR: Keep-alive task is STILL RUNNING

## Confirmed Hypothesis:
**Hypothesis #2: Keep-alive packets are sent but not received**
- Status: CONFIRMED
- We are sending keep-alives every 10 seconds
- We are NOT receiving any keep-alives back
- The connection times out after exactly 30 seconds

## Next Investigation:
- Why are keep-alive packets not being received?
- Are they being sent on the wire?
- Are they being dropped/filtered?
- Is vega gateway not sending them?
