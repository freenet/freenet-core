# Transport Layer Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Connection Health Checks (line 467-482)
- Added check for existing connections before establishing new ones
- Use `is_closed()` to verify if connection is still alive
- Only remove connections that are actually dead
- Reject new connection attempts if healthy connection exists

### 2. Better Error Handling for Packet Sending (line 315-334)
- Changed from `send()` to `try_send()` for non-blocking operation
- Handle `TrySendError::Full` by reinserting connection and logging
- Handle `TrySendError::Closed` by removing dead connection
- Prevents panic on channel errors

### 3. Duplicate Connection Prevention
- Check for existing connections in `ongoing_connections` (line 485-491)
- Prevent duplicate gateway connection attempts (line 373-376)
- Send proper error responses for duplicate attempts

### 4. Increased Channel Buffer Sizes
- Changed inbound packet channel buffers from 1 to 100 (lines 522, 685)
- Matches buffer sizes used in other parts of the system
- Prevents channel full errors during burst traffic

## Expected Impact
- Eliminates "channel closed" errors during connection establishment
- Prevents dropping healthy connections
- Better handles rapid connection attempts in constrained topologies
- More robust error handling for transport layer operations
