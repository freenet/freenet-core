# PUT Operation Network Send - Investigation Summary

## Problem
PUT operations timeout after 10 seconds because RequestPut notifications never reach the network layer.

## Investigation Timeline & Findings

### 1. Initial Hypothesis: Event Loop Exits ❌
**Theory**: Event loop task crashes/exits after PUT notification sent
**Test**: Added error logging to catch task exits in run_node select!
**Result**: NO exit messages logged - event loop is STILL RUNNING when timeout occurs

### 2. Channel Mechanism Test ✅
**Theory**: Notification channel has inherent bug
**Test**: Created 3 unit tests simulating event loop with biased select
**Result**: ALL TESTS PASS - channel mechanism works correctly in isolation

### 3. Channel Mismatch Test ❌  
**Theory**: OpManager sends to different channel than event loop receives from
**Test**: Added unique channel IDs to track sender/receiver pairs
**Result**: Channel IDs MATCH - OpManager and event loop use same channel (channel 1 for peer v6MWKgqHXDwYuTGc)

## Current State

### What Works ✅
1. Channel creation and pairing
2. OpManager has correct sender (channel 1)
3. Event loop has correct receiver (channel 1)
4. `.send().await` completes successfully
5. Event loop task continues running
6. Unit tests prove channel + biased select work

### What Doesn't Work ❌
1. `.recv()` in production event loop never fires for PUT notifications
2. PUT notification disappears between send and receive

## The Mystery

We have an impossible situation:
- Same channel pair
- Send completes
- Event loop running
- But receive never happens

This suggests either:
1. A tokio mpsc edge case/bug
2. Select! biased polling not working as expected in production
3. Some state corruption in the channel
4. A race condition we haven't identified

## Code Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. `p2p_impl.rs` - Enhanced error logging in run_node select!
2. `network_bridge.rs` - Added channel ID tracking + 3 unit tests  
3. `op_state_manager.rs` - Added channel ID to notification logs
4. `p2p_protoc.rs` - Added channel ID to event loop startup
5. `tracing/mod.rs` - Added tokio-console support
6. `Cargo.toml` - Added console-subscriber, tokio tracing feature

### All Tests Pass
```bash
test node::network_bridge::tests::test_notification_channel_with_biased_select ... ok
test node::network_bridge::tests::test_multiple_notifications ... ok  
test node::network_bridge::tests::test_send_fails_when_receiver_dropped ... ok
```

## Commits
- 5994b276: Add extensive debug logging
- 1894b478: Error handling + unit tests
- cc247a79: Tokio-console support
- 483fab02: Console subscriber initialization  
- d06ee934: Channel ID tracking

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Deep Dive into Select!
Add logging INSIDE the select! macro to see which futures are actually being polled:
- Log every time wait_for_event is called
- Log which select! branch would be ready
- Check if notifications_receiver.recv() future is even being created

### Option 2: Bypass Select! Test
Temporarily bypass the select! and directly poll notifications_receiver to see if it works:
```rust
if let Ok(msg) = timeout(Duration::from_millis(1), notification_channel.notifications_receiver.recv()).await {
    // Process msg
}
```

### Option 3: Channel Inspection  
Add tokio::mpsc channel introspection:
- Check sender count
- Check if receiver is dropped
- Check channel capacity/buffer state

### Option 4: Minimal Reproduction
Create a minimal test that reproduces the exact setup:
- 2 peers (gateway + regular)
- Real P2P conn manager
- Client event handling
- Event loop
- Single PUT operation

## Questions for Review

1. Could there be multiple EventLoopNotificationsReceiver instances somehow?
2. Is the notification_channel being moved/consumed elsewhere?
3. Could tokio runtime configuration affect mpsc behavior?
4. Any known issues with biased select! and mpsc channels?
