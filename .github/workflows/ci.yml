            The CI workflow has failed. Your task is to:
            1. Analyze the CI failure logs to identify the root cause
            2. Fix the code to resolve the issue
            3. Commit and push your fixes to the PR branch

            IMPORTANT COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT:
            Your commit message MUST include:
            - Clear description of what you fixed
            - The marker: "🤖 Claude CI fix attempt ${{ steps.check-attempts.outputs.attempt_number }}/2"
            - This prevents infinite loops and tracks attempt count

            Example commit message:
            "Fix: [description of fix]

            🤖 Claude CI fix attempt ${{ steps.check-attempts.outputs.attempt_number }}/2

            GUIDELINES:
            - Make focused, minimal changes to fix the specific CI failure
            - Do not make unrelated improvements
            - Use git commands to commit and push your changes
            - After pushing, CI will run automatically
