# v0.1.19 Test Summary

## Overview
v0.1.19 was created as a minimal revert to stable v0.1.14 with only necessary additions:
- Hector's diagnostics changes
- TOML dependency update
- Gateway configuration fixes
- CI timeout fixes

## Test Results

### CI Status
✅ All CI checks passing on PR #1723

### Gateway Test Framework Results
- ✅ **Build**: Successful (0.5s)
- ✅ **Basic Connection**: Peer successfully connected to gateway
- ✅ **40-Second Stability**: Connection remained stable
- ❌ **River Chat**: Failed with "No room_id returned"

### Key Findings

1. **Connection Success**: v0.1.19 successfully establishes connections between peers and gateways
   - Test gateway runs isolated (no connection to production gateway)
   - Peer connects to test gateway and maintains stable connection
   - fdev confirms connection established

2. **Stability**: Connection remains stable past the critical 40-second mark

3. **River Test Failure**: The River chat test failed, but this appears to be due to:
   - River contract deployment issues
   - riverctl configuration/compatibility
   - Not a core networking failure

### Logs Show Healthy Operation
- Gateway log shows: "Adding connection to peer"
- Peer log shows: "Outbound gateway connection successful"
- No critical errors during connection phase

## Conclusion
v0.1.19 achieves the primary goal of stable peer-to-gateway connectivity. The core networking functionality works correctly. River chat functionality requires additional investigation, but the foundation is solid.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy River contract to test environment
2. Debug riverctl integration with v0.1.19
3. Complete two-user River chat test
