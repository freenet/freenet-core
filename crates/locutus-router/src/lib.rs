/// as an `f64` where lower values indicate better outcomes and higher values indicate worse outcomes.
///
/// The estimator is trained on historical data and assumes that the outcome is proportional to the
/// distance between the peer and the contract, with longer distances resulting in worse outcomes,

/// if it has enough data points for accurate predictions. Otherwise, the global regression model

    // represents a simulated request made by a random `PeerId` at a random `Location` to retrieve data
    // from a contract at another random `Location`. Each event is created by calling the `simulate_request()`
    // helper function which calculates the distance between the `Peer` and the `Contract`, then estimates
    // the retrieval time based on the distance and some random factor. The list of events is then split
    // into two sets: a training set and a testing set.
    //
    // The `RoutingOutcomeEstimator` is then instantiated using the training set, and the `estimate_retrieval_time()`
    // method is called for each event in the testing set. The estimated retrieval time is compared to the
    // actual retrieval time recorded in the event, and the error between the two is calculated. The average
    // error across all events is then calculated, and the test passes if the average error is less than 0.01.
