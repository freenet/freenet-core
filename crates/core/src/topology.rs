/// requests at a given location.

/// The `TopologyManager` uses the density map to select the best candidate
/// location, which is assumed to be close to peer connections that are
/// currently receiving a lot of requests. This should have the effect of
/// "balancing" out requests over time.

/// The `TopologyManager` also uses a `ConnectionEvaluator` to evaluate whether
/// a given connection is better than all other connections within a predefined
/// time window. The goal of this is to select the best connections over time
