/*
This module provides a metric called `SmallWorldDeviationMetric` to quantify
how well a given peer's connections in a peer-to-peer network approximate an
ideal small-world topology. The ideal topology is based on a 1D ring model
where the probability density of a connection at distance `r` is proportional
to `r^-1`.

The metric is calculated as follows:
1. A normalization constant `C` is calculated to ensure that the total
   probability of the ideal distribution is 1.
2. For a range of distances `X`, the ideal and actual proportions of peers
   within `X` are calculated.
3. The area between the ideal and actual curves is calculated using trapezoidal
   integration, yielding the `SmallWorldDeviationMetric`.

A metric value close to 0 indicates that the actual distribution closely matches
the ideal. A positive value indicates a lack of long-range links, and a negative
value indicates a lack of short-range links.
