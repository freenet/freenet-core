# Introduction

Freenet is a distributed, decentralized alternative to the centralized World
Wide Web, designed to unleash a new era of innovation, competition, while
protecting freedom of speech and privacy. 

At the core of Freenet is a small piece of software known as the Freenet kernel,
which runs on users' computers, smartphones, or other devices. The kernel is
tiny, less than 5 MB, allowing it to be installed installed in a matter of
seconds and is compatible with a wide range of hardware.

Freenet is a peer-to-peer network, which means that nodes self-organize into a
global network without any central authority, and the work of hosting services
is distributed among the users.

This user manual is primarily intended for developers who wish to build
decentralized software systems on the Freenet platform.
