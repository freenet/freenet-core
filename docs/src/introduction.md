# Introduction

Freenet is a distributed and decentralized alternative to the centralized World
Wide Web, designed to foster innovation, competition, and protect freedom of
speech and privacy. As a global decentralized computer, it allows anyone to
contribute to its growth and development. 

This unique platform aims to counteract the centralization of the web, which has
hindered progress and jeopardized individual liberties. Furthermore, Freenet is
a resilient communication network that can operate on today's internet
infrastructure as well as adapt to future satellite or mesh networks.
