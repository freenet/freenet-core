# Introduction

Freenet is a distributed, decentralized alternative to the centralized World
Wide Web, designed to unleash a new era of innovation and competition, while
protecting freedom of speech and privacy. 

At the core of Freenet is the Freenet kernel, which runs on users' computers,
smartphones, or other devices. The kernel is tiny, less than 5 MB, allowing it
to be installed in a matter of seconds and is compatible with a wide range of
hardware.

Freenet is a [peer-to-peer network](architecture/p2p-network.md), which means
that computers that are part of the network self-organize into a global network
without any central authority, and the work of hosting services is distributed
among the users.
