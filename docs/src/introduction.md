# Introduction

Freenet is a distributed and decentralized alternative to the centralized World
Wide Web, designed to foster innovation, competition, and protect freedom of
speech and privacy. As a global decentralized computer, it allows anyone to
contribute to its growth and development. 

Freenet consists of a small core system, written in Rust, that runs on the
user's computer, or "Freenet node". Freenet's binary is tiny, less than 5 MB,
allowing it to be installed in seconds and run on a wide variety of hardware.

Freenet is a peer-to-peer network, which means that nodes self-organize into a
global network without any central authority, and the work of hosting services
is distributed among the users.

This user manual is primarily intended for developers who wish to build
decentralized software systems on the Freenet platform.
