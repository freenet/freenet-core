# Introduction

Freenet is a software platform that makes it easy to build sophisticated
alternatives to the web's centralized services. Like the web, users interact
with Freenet through web browsers, but unlike the web, these services don't need
to depend on any centralized servers or organizations.

Freenet consists of a small core system, written in Rust, that runs on the
user's computer, or "Freenet node". Freenet's binary is tiny, less than 5 MB,
allowing it to be installed in seconds and run on a wide variety of hardware.

Freenet is a peer-to-peer network, which means that nodes self-organize into a
global network without any central authority, and the work of hosting services
is distributed among the users.

This user manual is primarily intended for developers who wish to build
decentralized software systems on the Freenet platform.
