# Getting Started

This tutorial will show you how to build decentralized software on Freenet.

## Prerequisites

### Rust and Cargo

This will install a Rust development environment including cargo on Linux or a
Mac (for Windows see [here](https://rustup.rs)):

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### Locutus Dev Tool (LTD)

Once you have a working installation of Cargo you can install the Locutus dev
tools:

```bash
$ cargo install locutus
```

This command will install `ldt` (Locutus Dev Tool) and a working Freenet kernel that can
be used for local development.
