# Progress Summary - GET Operation Performance

## What We've Fixed

### 1. NAT Traversal Timeout (✅ FIXED)
- **Problem**: Connections were taking 600ms+ on localhost due to timeout-based retry mechanism
- **Solution**: Changed INITIAL_TIMEOUT from 600ms to 50ms, set TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER to 1.0
- **Result**: Connections now establish quickly

### 2. Connection Configuration (✅ FIXED)  
- **Problem**: min_connections was set to 25 (impossible for 3-node test network)
- **Solution**: Set min_connections to 2 for test nodes
- **Result**: Realistic connection requirements for small networks

### 3. Gateway Connection Detection (✅ FIXED)
- **Problem**: initial_join_procedure only connected if open_connections == 0
- **Solution**: Modified to check for unconnected gateways specifically
- **Result**: Nodes properly connect to all available gateways

### 4. Connection Maintenance Interval (✅ FIXED)
- **Problem**: Connection maintenance ran every 60 seconds (too slow for tests)
- **Solution**: Set CHECK_TICK_DURATION to 2 seconds for tests
- **Result**: Faster connection acquisition in test environments

### 5. Immediate Peer Discovery (✅ FIXED)
- **Problem**: Peers weren't sending CONNECT messages immediately after gateway connection
- **Solution**: Implemented immediate FindOptimalPeer request after gateway connection
- **Result**: Nodes now have 2 connections within 1 second of startup

## Current Status

Despite all the connection improvements, GET operations still take ~13 seconds in the test. The delay appears to be in the GET operation routing/execution itself, not in connection establishment.

### Timeline of a GET Operation:
1. 0s: Nodes start up
2. ~1s: All nodes connected (gateway + peer connections established)
3. ~15s: Node1 publishes contract
4. ~20s: Node2 sends GET request
5. **~33s: Node2 receives GET response (13 second delay!)**

## Remaining Issues

The 13-second GET operation delay is still present. This appears to be due to:
1. Routing delays in finding the contract
2. Possible backtracking/retry logic in the GET operation
3. Contract execution/loading overhead

## Next Steps

To achieve acceptable performance for GET operations:
1. Investigate GET operation routing logic
2. Check if backtracking search is causing delays
3. Optimize contract caching and routing
4. Consider pre-warming contract execution environment
