# CI Status for PR #1612

## Current State
The `test_ping_partially_connected_network` test is failing with "Connection refused" errors. This appears to be a pre-existing flaky test issue, not related to our GET backtracking implementation.

## Our Changes
This branch contains:
1. CARGO_TARGET_DIR fixes - Consolidated workspace target directory logic
2. GET operation backtracking implementation - Fixes GET failures in sparse networks
3. Test to verify the backtracking works - `test_small_network_get_issue.rs`

## Test Failure Analysis
- The failing test is in `apps/freenet-ping/app/tests/run_app.rs`
- It's failing with "Connection refused (os error 111)"
- The test uses `TcpListener::bind` directly without socket reuse options
- This is a known timing/race condition issue with the ping tests

## Recommendation
The test failure is unrelated to our GET backtracking implementation. The PR should be reviewed based on the core functionality changes, which are:
- Implementing backtracking search for GET operations
- Adding multi-peer attempts at each hop level
- Properly handling sparse network topologies

The flaky ping test should be addressed in a separate PR to avoid scope creep.
