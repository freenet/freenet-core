# Freenet

The Internet has grown increasingly centralized over the past two decades, such
that a handful of companies now effectively control the Internet infrastructure.
The public square is privately owned, threatening freedom of speech and
democracy.

Freenet is a software platform that makes it easy to create decentralized
alternatives to today's centralized tech companies. These decentralized apps
will be easy to use, scalable, and secured through cryptography.

To learn more about Freenet as a developer read [The User
Manual](https://docs.freenet.org/). For an introduction to Freenet watch **Ian's
talk and Q&A** - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/d31jmv5Tx5k) /
[Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/740461100).

## Status

Freenet is currently under development. Using our [development
guide](https://docs.freenet.org/tutorial.html), developers can experiment with
building decentralized applications using our SDK and testing them locally.

## Applications

Examples of what can be built on Freenet include:

- Decentralized email (with a gateway to legacy email via the @freenet.org
  domain)
- Decentralized microblogging (think Twitter or Facebook)
- Instant Messaging (Whatsapp, Signal)
- Online Store (Amazon)
- Discussion (Reddit, HN)
- Video discovery (Youtube, TikTok)
- Search (Google, Bing)

All will be completely decentralized, scalable, and cryptographically secure. We
want Freenet to be useful out-of-the-box, so we plan to provide reference
implementations for some or all of these.

## How does it work?

Freenet is a decentralized key-value database. It uses the same [small
world](https://freenetproject.org/assets/papers/lic.pdf) routing algorithm as
the original Freenet design, but each key is a cryptographic contract
implemented in [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org/), and the value
associated with each contract is called its _state_. The role of the
cryptographic contract is to specify what state is allowed for this contract,
and how the state is modified.

A very simple contract might require that the state is a list of messages, each
signed with a specific cryptographic keypair. The state can be updated to add
new messages if appropriately signed. Something like this could serve as the
basis for a blog or Twitter feed.

Freenet is implemented in Rust and will be available across all major operating
systems, desktop and mobile.

## What is Locutus?

Locutus was the working title used for this successor to the original Freenet,
in March 2023 it was renamed to "Freenet", this repository was
renamed from `locutus` to `freenet-core` in September 2023.

## What is Hyphanet?

The original Freenet codebase is now called Hyphanet. It is still actively
developed by the same maintainers as before, and is available
[here](https://www.hyphanet.org).

don't make this your only point of contact with us.

## Acknowledgements and Funding

### Protocol Labs

In addition to creating the excellent
[libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p) which we use for low-level
transport, Protocol Labs has generously supported our work with a grant.

### FUTO

FUTO has generously awarded Freenet two Legendary Grants to support Freenet
development.
