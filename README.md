# Decentralize Everything

Freenet is the internet as it should be—fully decentralized, designed to put you back in control. Imagine a global shared 
computer where you can communicate and collaborate freely, without reliance on big tech. Freenet lets you regain your 
digital independence.

Freenet is a peer-to-peer network that transforms users’ computers into a resilient, distributed platform on which anyone 
can build decentralized services. Every peer contributes to a fault-tolerant collective, ensuring services are always 
available and robust.

Today’s web is a series of siloed services, but every system built on Freenet is fully interoperable by default. Freenet 
apps can be built with popular web frameworks, accessed through any browser just like the web.

## Build Instructions

To install the Freenet core:

```bash
$ cargo install --path crates/core
```

Or for the fdev utility:

```bash
$ cargo install --path crates/fdev
```
