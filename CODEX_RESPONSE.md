# Response to Codex Feedback

Thank you for the thorough review! You caught some critical issues. Here's my response:

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Fixed: `todo!()` panic in testing harness (Critical)

**Your concern:** The testing harness hits `todo!()` for `WaitingTransaction::Subscription`, causing panics in tests.

**What I fixed:**
- Replaced the `todo!()` with proper handling in `testing_impl.rs:866`
- Now logs subscription requests and lets the contract notification system handle routing
- Fix pushed in branch `fix/codex-feedback-1853` (commit 1aa5c8e2)

**Why we missed it:** Our unit tests don't exercise the full testing harness path. The integration tests we attempted would have caught this, but they failed for unrelated configuration issues before reaching this code path.

### 2. ⚠️ Needs PR 1853 Fix: `block_in_place` issue in `update.rs`

**Your concern:** `block_in_place` will panic on current-thread runtime and blocks worker threads unnecessarily.

**Status:** This issue is in PR #1853's code, not in our PR #1854. The problematic code needs to be fixed there by making `get_broadcast_targets_update` async or maintaining a non-async view of the neighbor cache.

### 3. ⚠️ Needs PR 1853 Fix: Neighbor cache never pruned

**Your concern:** The `neighbor_caches` map grows indefinitely without pruning disconnected peers.

**Status:** This is also in PR #1853. The fix would involve hooking into connection teardown or implementing time-based eviction based on `last_update`.

## Why Our Testing Didn't Catch These

1. **Testing harness issue**: Our unit tests mock at a higher level and don't go through the full `testing_impl` path. We focused on testing the subscription state machine directly.

2. **Integration test challenges**: We attempted comprehensive multi-node integration tests but encountered:
   - Configuration serialization issues
   - Threading/async complexity with non-Send futures
   - Race conditions in test setup
   - These failures prevented us from reaching the code paths that would have exposed the `todo!()`

3. **PR overlap**: Issues #2 and #3 are in PR #1853's proximity cache code, which we don't have in our branch.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Immediate**: The critical `todo!()` fix is ready in `fix/codex-feedback-1853`
2. **For PR 1853**: The `block_in_place` and cache pruning issues need to be addressed there
3. **For PR 1854**: Once the testing harness fix is merged, our subscription fixes should be solid

## Testing Improvements

Going forward, we should:
- Add tests that exercise the full testing harness path
- Consider property-based testing for state machine transitions
- Separate integration test infrastructure from application-specific helpers

The subscription fixes themselves (transaction ID correlation, removing early return, k=3 peer selection) are solid and well-tested at the unit level. The issue was in the testing infrastructure layer that would have been used to validate them end-to-end.
